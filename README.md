# Readable Project (redux) 

This is my project submission for the Udacity React & Redux course.

Users are able to post content to predefined categories, comment on their posts and other users' posts, vote on posts and comments, and edit and delete posts and comments.

## Try it out 

* Install and start the API server
    - `cd api-server`
    - `npm install`
    - `node server`
* (In another terminal window) Install and start the development server
    - `cd frontend`
    - `npm start`

## API Server

The api is from the starter template here: https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-readable-starter

Information about the API server and how to use it can be found in its [README file](api-server/README.md).
